Note: Some of the described methods may work under Unix only. Don't ask
me how to do it under Windows - Windows is UNSUPPORTED!



Prerequesites
-------------
Of course you require PHP (available at http://www.php.net). The classes
use several things only available in PHP 4, i.e. PHP 3 does NOT work. It
doesn't matter if you use the command line version of PHP (i.e. CGI) or a
web server module. If you use a web server module, I strongly recommend
you NOT to use Windows/IIS. This stuff is just too unreliable.

You will also need pdflib (available at http://www.pdflib.com).
Version 4.0.2 or later is strongly recommended. Versions prior to
4.0.0 didn't have any official PHP support and version 4.0.1
has a bug in the PHP binding when getting capsheight/ascender/descender
values from a font.

You also MUST build PHP with pdflib support and with the C source files
included in the pdflib package, not with the ones included in the
PHP distribution! To do this, copy pdf.c and php_pdf.h from
/usr/src/pdflib-4.0.1/bind/php/ext/pdf/ to /usr/src/php-4.x.x/ext/pdf/
and rebuild PHP.



Running the examples
--------------------
The examples require that you use a web server module version of PHP,
otherwise you have to modify them so that the PDF data gets output
into a file.

Simply extract the tarball into a directory accessible via the web
server and instruct your web browser to point to this directory.
You will see a small web page (the index.html file) with links
to the different examples. Just click on them and you will see
the generated PDF documents.



Installing the classes
----------------------
You have two choices to install the class files. In both cases all you
have to copy is "class.*.inc.php".

If you are going to develop an application which you plan to distribute,
the best method is probably to copy the files to the directory where
your application files reside. When distributing your application, just
include the php_jh_pdf files.

If you are going to install php_jh_pdf on a machine which runs several
applications that use php_jh_pdf, you might like to put the class
files into a central directory (maybe /usr/local/lib/php4) and instruct
PHP to search files in this directory (use the include_path directive
in your php.ini file).



Installing multiple versions of php_jh_pdf
------------------------------------------
As you have probably noticed, all the class files include a version number,
so you can install multiple versions of php_jh_pdf without any problem.
If you dislike to change the file names in your application files every
time you upgrade php_jh_pdf, use symbolic links, just like ld.so does.
